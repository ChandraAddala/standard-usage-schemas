__Project Summary__

This project contains files related to Cloud Feeds API contract. For more information read the [Project Overview](https://github.com/rackerlabs/standard-usage-schemas/wiki/Overview).

__Schemas__

In a typical Atom Hopper Usage Entry, there are three separate schema definitions contained within a single entry – product schema, core event schema, and entry schema. There is a well-defined provision to create multiple versions of the schema in different files or in the same file, which are illustrated under Schema Versioning](https://github.com/rackerlabs/standard-usage-schemas/wiki/Versioning). Also, rules for the display of various attributes for the user’s usage summary message could be found at [Usage Summary Messages](https://github.com/rackerlabs/standard-usage-schemas/wiki/Usage-Summary-Messages). This is helpful in distinguishing the billable attributes from non-billable ones and thereby invoking corresponding actions.
